### Early Diagnosis of Skin Diseases  
Skin diseases are a global health challenge, making early and accurate diagnosis essential for effective treatment. 
Traditional methods relying on visual assessments by dermatologists often result in subjective judgments and inconsistent 
quality. Deep learning offers a promising solution by automating this process to improve consistency, reduce variability, 
and enhance efficiency, as noted by Zhang et al. (2024).  

### CNNs in Medical Image Analysis  
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning algorithm, excel at processing structured data like images. 
They mimic the human brain's ability to recognize patterns, making them ideal for tasks like image recognition and classification. 
CNNs use convolutional layers to extract features, pooling layers to simplify data, and fully connected layers to synthesize results. 
Widely adopted in healthcare, CNNs are instrumental in automating medical image analysis, including skin disease diagnosis.  

### Skin Lesion Classification System  
This project aims to develop a CNN-based system to classify skin lesions into 10 conditions, addressing challenges like variability 
in lesion appearance due to lighting, angles, and skin tones. It will prioritize balanced accuracy for underrepresented conditions and 
ensure ease of use for healthcare providers, offering a robust tool for enhancing diagnostic precision. 
The 10 skin lesions classified are:


* Atopic Dermatitis
* Cellulitis, Impetigo and other Bacterial Infections
* Eczema 
* Bullous Disease 
* Hair Loss, Alopecia and other Hair Diseases
* Exanthems and Drug Eruptions
* Herpes, HPV and other STDs 
* Acne and Rosacea
* Light Diseases and Disorders of Pigmentation
* Actinic Keratosis, Basal Cell Carcinoma and other Malignant Lesions

### Disclaimer  

This system is designed to assist in the classification of skin lesions for educational and research purposes only. It is not intended to 
replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The results generated by the system should be reviewed and interpreted by 
qualified healthcare professionals.  

While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, the system may not perform equally well across all skin tones, lighting conditions, 
or lesion types, and its predictions may be affected by limitations in the dataset used for training. Users are advised to consider these 
factors when utilizing the tool.  

The developers of this system are not responsible for any decisions made or actions taken based on its output. Always consult a licensed 
medical professional for any health-related concerns.
